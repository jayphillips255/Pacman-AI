# Pacman-AI

## This Project ##
The first part of this project follows a tutorial for SDL2 game development
You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44tO977slsU&t=418s
The tutorial serves as a guide for developing general game structure, but is not specific to Pacman

## Compiling and Running ##
This project has been configured for Windows only.
A different library setup is needed for other operating systems.
Type: "make" in the terminal to compile the project. I'm using mingw64.
Type: "make run" to run the project.

## A Note about SDL ##
